- TLS Transport Layer Security - A protocol to provide communications
   security over the Internet. It allows client/server applications to
  communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,
 tampering, or message forgery.
- SSL Secure Sockets Layer - See above. This was the protocol as originally
   defined at Netscape and went through several revisions before being
  replaced by TLS based on SSL 3.0.
- PKI Public Key Infrastructure - A set of hardware, software, people, policies,
   and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and
  revoke digital certificates
- CA Certificate Authority - An entity that issues digital certificates
- D-H Diffie-Hellman key exchange - A method for two parties that have no
   prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key
  over an insecure communication channel
- MitM Man-in-the-middle attack - A form of active eavesdropping where the
    attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays
   messages between them. Victims believe that they are securely talking
  directly to each other but the channel is controlled by the attacker.
- WoT Web of Trust - A means for systems to establish the authenticity of the
   binding between a public key and its owner based on a series of trust
  assertions. An alternative to the more hierarchical PKI/CA approach.


- FTP: FTPS (explicit) over standard FTP via "AUTH TLS"
    - This is not the same as SFTP (file transfer via SSH)
- SMTP: Using STARTTLS enabling a plain text connection to upgrade to an encrypted connection on the same port
- NNTP: Network News Transfer Protocol as NNTPS (port 563)
- XMPP: Used to encrypt the communication channel. Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is used for authentication
- VPN: OpenVPN uses TLS for key exchange
- SIP: Encrypted on port 5061

HSTS: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTP connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL[1]). HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.
